title: "The Power Of Time"
---

There are three main ingredients in investing:

- __time__: how long you invest

- __return__: what rate of return you get

- __contribution__: the money you contribute

From the most simplistic point of view, we have the classic formula of 
compounding interest (future value):

$$
FV = P \times (1 + r)^n
$$

- $n$: number of years
- $r$: annual rate of return
- $P$: principal amount
- $FV$: future value
